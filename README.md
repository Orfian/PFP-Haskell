### README for PFP Repository  

This repository contains my assignments for the PFP (Practical Functional Programming) course. Below is a brief overview of the completed assignments:  

---

#### **Homework 1: Automata**  
- Implemented functions to determine if a finite automaton is deterministic, validate input strings against an automaton, and convert non-deterministic automatons into deterministic ones.  
- Types and transitions were represented using Haskell data structures for clarity and efficiency.  

---

#### **Homework 2: Automata and Regular Expressions**  
- Designed a data structure to represent regular expressions and implemented a function to convert regular expressions into finite automatons.  
- Focused on the theoretical foundations of automata and their equivalence with regular expressions.  

---

#### **Homework 3: Immutable Data Structures**  
- Created an immutable array represented as a ternary tree using Haskell's persistent data structures.  
- Implemented constructors, enumerators, indexers, and a `set` method to accommodate immutability while allowing efficient updates.  

---

#### **Homework 4: Arrays and Vectors in Haskell**  
- Developed a quicksort algorithm using mutable arrays (`STArray`) in Haskell.  
- Focused on combining functional paradigms with mutable state for performance-critical operations.
